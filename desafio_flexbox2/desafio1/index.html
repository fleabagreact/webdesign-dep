            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>A getaway car is typically used in movies for criminals to escape from the scene post-crime. This is a reference to the infamous criminal couple Bonnie and Clyde. On May 23, 1934, after a long history of criminal activity, Bonnie and Clyde were ambushed and killed by police as they tried to flee in a 1934 Ford Deluxe.</p>
            <p>Taylor draws from the story of Bonnie and Clyde to warn her lover in this line. Since their love started in a “getaway car” – as a rebound to get out of her previous relationship – they were doomed from the start of their relationship.</p>
            <p>“Sirens” helps bring the image of a crime scene to life, with the love Taylor receives from her new man being a constant reminder of an improper act she committed. In this case, Taylor used her new man as the “getaway car” to get away from a stale, possibly unhealthy, relationship. However, given the nature of how it started, it was highly unlikely that their love would last.</p>
            <p>Many have speculated that this song is most likely a reference to Taylor’s romance with actor Tom Hiddleston, who she met at the 2016 Met Gala, while she was still publicly dating DJ Calvin Harris. This reinstates the idea that Tom served as a “getaway car” for her to break it off with Calvin.</p>
            <p>The song comes full circle, and just as Taylor left Calvin for Tom in a getaway car, it seems that she has now done the same to Tom – eventually leaving him for someone else.</p>
            <p>She cries as she gets away, evidencing the fact that they both are hurt by the situation– but she nonetheless leaves. </p>

            <h2>Lyrics</h2>
            <p><strong>[Verse 1]</strong><br>
                It was the best of times, the worst of crimes<br>
                I struck a match and blew your mind<br>
                But I didn’t mean it and you didn't see it<br>
                The ties were black, the lies were white<br>
                In shades of gray in candlelight<br>
                I wanted to leave him, I needed a reason
            </p>
                
            <p><strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong><br>
                "X" marks the spot where we fell apart<br>
                He poisoned the well, I was lyin' to myself<br>
                I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed<br>
                We never had a shotgun shot in the dark (Oh)
            </p>
                
            <p><strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
                You were drivin’ the getaway car<br>
                We were flyin', but we'd never get far<br>
                Don't pretend it's such a mystery<br>
                Think about the place where you first met me<br>
                Ridin' in a getaway car<br>
                There were sirens in the beat of your heart<br>
                Shoulda known I'd be the first to leave<br>
                Think about the place where you first met me
            </p>
                
            <p><strong>[Post-Chorus]</strong><br>
                In a getaway car (Oh-oh-oh)<br>
                No, they never get far (Oh-oh-ah)<br>
                No, nothin' good starts in a getaway car
            </p>
                
            <p><strong>[Verse 2]</strong><br>
                It was the great escape, the prison break<br>
                The light of freedom on my face<br>
                But you weren’t thinkin’ and I was just drinkin'<br>
                While he was runnin’ after us, I was screamin', "Go, go, go"<br>
                But with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow<br>
                And a circus ain't a love story and now we’re both sorry (We're both sorry)
            </p>
                
            <p><strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong><br>
                "X" marks the spot where we fell apart<br>
                He poisoned the well, every man for himself<br>
                I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed<br>
                It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart (Oh)
            </p>
                
            <p><strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
                You were drivin' the getaway car<br>
                We were flyin', but we'd never get far<br>
                Don't pretend it's such a mystery<br>
                Think about the place where you first met me<br>
                Ridin' in a getaway car<br>
                There were sirens in the beat of your heart<br>
                Shoulda known I'd be the first to leave<br>
                Think about the place where you first met me
            </p>
                
            <p><strong>[Post-Chorus]</strong><br>
                In a getaway car (Oh-oh-oh)<br>
                No, they never get far (Oh-oh-ah)<br>
                No, nothin' good starts in a getaway car
            </p>
                
            <p><strong>[Bridge]</strong><br>
                We were jet-set, Bonnie and Clyde (Oh-oh)<br>
                Until I switched to the other side, to the other side<br>
                It's no surprise I turned you in (Oh-oh)<br>
                'Cause us traitors never win
            </p>
                
            <p><strong>[Breakdown]</strong><br>
                I'm in a getaway car<br>
                I left you in a motel bar<br>
                Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys<br>
                That was the last time you ever saw me (Oh)
            </p>
                
            <p><strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
                Drivin' the getaway car<br>
                We were flyin', but we'd never get far (Don't pretend)<br>
                Don't pretend it's such a mystery<br>
                Think about the place where you first met me<br>
                Ridin' in a getaway car<br>
                There were sirens in the beat of your heart (Shoulda known)<br>
                Shoulda known I'd be the first to leave<br>
                Think about the place where you first met me
            </p>                

            <p><strong>[Post-Chorus]</strong><br>
                In a getaway car (Oh-oh-oh)<br>
                No, they never get far, oh-oh-ah<br>
                No, nothin' good starts in a getaway car
            </p>
                
            <p><strong>[Outro]</strong><br>
                I was ridin' in a getaway car<br>
                I was cryin' in a getaway car<br>
                I was dyin' in a getaway car<br>
                Said goodbye in a getaway car<br>
                Ridin' in a getaway car<br>
                I was cryin' in a getaway car<br>
                I was dyin' in a getaway car<br>
                Said goodbye in a getaway car
